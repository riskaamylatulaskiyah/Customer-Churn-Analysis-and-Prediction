# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction

Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing their relationship or subscription with a company, impacting revenue and growth. In this dataset, churn is labeled to show whether a customer has left or stayed. Analyzing churn helps businesses identify patterns and factors contributing to customer loss and develop strategies to retain them.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging statistical methods and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights for business strategies to improve customer retention.

## Business Objective

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to maintain and grow their customer base. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, companies can take proactive measures to improve customer satisfaction, offer targeted incentives, and ultimately reduce churn rates, leading to sustained revenue and growth.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about customers and their interactions with the company. It is used to analyze customer churn and build predictive models.
